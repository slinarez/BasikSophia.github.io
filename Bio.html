    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p2>Sophia Linarez is a Guatemalan - American artist belonging to the Bay Area. She has grown up here her entire life and has been able to experience different types of media and culture around her, which she incorporates into her artwork. 
      She likes to incorporate the different inspiration she gets from her favorite films, artists, musicians, video games and from the people in her lifes. She wants others to see her work and get a sense of nostalgia and invoke a feeling of relatability. 
      She incorporates media that she has been surrounded by since she was young and has never been able to let go of the childish side of her. Sophia Linarez strives to create art not only for herself but those around her, she wants to make people think about one's sense of self and to show that no matter where you are in life or how old you are, you can still like “childish” things and enjoy them.
